Reference parser for TAO

Interactive version to try at [tree-annotation.org](https://tree-annotation.org/parser.html).

The parser is implemented in simple JavaScript. The implementation can be used as a reference for more advanced parsers.

Note that in JavaScript:

* a function returns undefined by default; undefined is falsy
* the || operator only evaluates and returns its right operand if the left one is falsy; otherwise it returns the left one
